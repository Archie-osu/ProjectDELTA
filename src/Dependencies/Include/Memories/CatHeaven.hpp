/*

	May my cat, Mikeš, who unfortunately passed away today, rest in peace.
	He was sadly ran over after being startled by a nearby dog.
	He was a good cat, whose life was sadly cut short. He had a great life ahead of himself.

	Rest in peace, my good friend.
	You may be in heaven, but the memory of you remains here, on Earth, and in this project.
