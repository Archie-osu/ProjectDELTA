# FAQ
**Q:** Where are the releases? Where can I download this tool?

**A:** Click [here](https://github.com/Archie-osu/ProjectDELTA/releases/latest)

**Q:** The loader says that it can't find ``ProjectDELTA.dll``, what is wrong?

**A:** The loader executable ``loader.exe`` must be in the same folder as the DLL ``ProjectDELTA.dll``. Try moving them to a folder on your desktop. If that doesn't work, message me on Discord.

**Q:** My Antivirus tells me this is a virus, why?

**A:** The loader comes with statically linked libraries, thus some AVs interpret it as malware. Simply make an exception in your Antivirus software. This is not malware.
