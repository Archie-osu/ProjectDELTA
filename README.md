# FAQ
**Q:** The game crashes when I launch DELTARUNE, even though the loader says "Done". What am I doing wrong?

**A:** You've encountered a bug is fixed in v1.0.0 - update.

**Q:** The loader says that it can't find ``ProjectDELTA.dll``, what is wrong?

**A:** The loader executable ``loader.exe`` must be in the same folder as the DLL ``ProjectDELTA.dll``. Try moving them to a folder on your desktop. If that doesn't work, message me on Discord.

**Q:** My Antivirus tells me this is a virus, why?

**A:** The loader comes with statically linked libraries, thus some AVs interpret it as malware. Simply make an exception in your Antivirus software. This is not malware.
