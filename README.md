# FAQ
**Q:** The game crashes when I launch DELTARUNE, even though the loader says "Done". What am I doing wrong?
**A:** You've encountered a bug that will be fixed in the next version, for the time being launch DELTARUNE first, then launch the loader.

**Q:** The loader says that it can't find ``ProjectDELTA.dll``, what is wrong?
**A:** The loader executable ``loader.exe`` must be in the same folder as the DLL ``ProjectDELTA.dll``. Try moving them to a folder on your desktop. If that doesn't work, message me on Discord.
